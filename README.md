# CS231n
Solution to assignments in Stanford CS Class [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.github.io/). 
The [lecture videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vT1JzLTH4G4&list=PL3FW7Lu3i5JvHM8ljYj-zLfQRF3EO8sYv) are on YouTube. 
This repo contains my solution to the assignments. <br/>With thanks to the awesome folks at Stanford for making the course content available to all.

(Note: PyTorch notebooks have been solved for questions which give the option of using either PyTorch or TensorFlow.)
